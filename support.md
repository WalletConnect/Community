***Public SLA commitment***

WalletConnect prides itself on building great software that makes the lives of developers easier. As part of that commitment we want to give guidance on both where to go with questions and what expectations you should have around receiving support. 

**Where to post Questions**
 

 - **Discord**
	 -  One good place to ask questions in in the “Developer Support” section of our discord. This section utilizes forum style posts so you can search through previous posts and to make is easier to respond to everyone.

 - **Github** 
	 - Github Discussions is another place you’re welcome to ask questions. We recognize many people don’t have or like discord so our discussions page is another great place to ask questions.

**Bug Reports and Feature requests**

 - Most developers are familiar with making bug reports and feature requests. 
	 - **Bug Reports:** if you’re certain you’ve found a bug, create an issue on the repository in question. Please make sure to follow our bug report template to ensure we have all the information needed to fix it
    - **Feature Requests:** If there is a feature you’d like to see on a WalletConnect product create an issue on that repository and make sure to follow the provided template. 

**Support Expectations**

 - If you post your question in the appropriate forum on the WalletConnect discord server you will get a response within one business day
 - You will get an answer or notice of escalation within two business days
 - If your issue is suspected of being a bug, we may ask you to fill out a bug report. If you’ve already provided sufficient information for one, we’ll post it for you and share a link to the issue. Once a report is submitted you’ll be updated on the progress and be notified when we’ve shipped a fix for that bug
 - If you report a bug or a feature it will be labled with the “community suggestion” flag. It will then be reviewed by the core team and either closed or accepted. Accepted status means that the issue/feature will be triaged and added to the roadmap
